It's a no-brainer that when comparing team performance on retention, the departure of one person in small teams with fewer members will have a more significant impact on turnover rates than it does in larger teams. However, this creates room for potential misinterpretation and inadequate actions. 

It's related to the well-known phenomenon of variation being more likely in smaller samples. Fans of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky will probably recall the famous [cognitive bias of insensitivity to sample size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitivity_to_sample_size) which occurs when people judge the probability of obtaining a statistic regardless of sample size. 

One way to reduce this effect is [Bayesian shrinkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkage_(statistics)). This approach, which serves as a kind of [regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)), involves borrowing information from the overall company turnover rate to influence the turnover rate of smaller teams. It works by "shrinking" the turnover rate of smaller teams towards the company average, and thus creating a balance between the observed rate and the company average.

It's not dissimilar to what one intuitively does when deciding what movie to watch or what restaurant to go to, when movies and restaurants vary widely in the number of ratings available.

You can see this approach in action on the chart below. The smaller the team and the further its turnover rate is from the company-wide turnover rate (the vertical dashed line), the more the turnover rate estimate for that team is shifted towards the company-wide value (the distance between the red cross and the black dot) - see, for example, teams 4 and 6. For comparison, check teams 12 and 9 that don't show much of a shrinkage effect due to the big size and small distance from the company-wide turnover rate, respectively.
