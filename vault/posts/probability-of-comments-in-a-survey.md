I've been curious about this for a while, but until recently, I only had my personal pet theories to rely on. Luckily, one of my recent projects gave me the chance to explore this question with real-world data and satisfy my curiosity a bit.

Why bother? Well, you can get a better feel for the representativeness of the comments, from which a lot of useful insights into the employee experience can be gleaned.  

Btw, what’s your guess? And try to make a prediction before reading on and/or checking the charts – with hindsight the results may seem too obvious 😉

To test my ideas, I used a classification RF model to be able to capture non-linear relationships, and used item score and some common controls as predictors of whether an employee would leave a comment on a given item. Then, I applied Partial Dependence Plot – a global ML interpretation tool – to the fitted model to examine the relationship between item scores and the likelihood of leaving a comment.

What were the results? Well, as usual, it depends. However, across the sample of items shown, we can observe a common pattern of a non-linear, S-reversed-shaped relationship. Dissatisfied employees tend to comment more, except for those who are extremely dissatisfied. As satisfaction increases, the probability of commenting decreases, only to slightly rise again as we approach a satisfaction level of 10. Generally, it can be said that less satisfied employees comment more on average. Given that we collect feedback from employees to improve things, it makes kind of sense, right? 🤓

Does this match your expectations, or are you surprised? Would you expect different patterns for different items? Have you conducted a similar exercise with your own data? If so, what were the results? Perhaps you also know of some relevant research on this topic. Feel free to share.

P.S. If you would like to replicate this analysis using your own data, you can use the following Python script as inspiration.
