I recently came across a post discussing research that highlights how the prediction power of personality traits in relation to business outcomes may be underestimated because most studies rely on linear analytical methods, which, unlike many ML algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost, fail to capture and utilize nonlinear signals in the data.

This led me to reflect that maybe it’s not just the prediction power that suffers from this limitation. The true nature and shape of these relationships are likely misunderstood as well as a result of relying on linear methods. We’re used to reading about positive or negative correlations between personality traits and various outcomes, but the reality is probably more complex and nuanced.

For a quick visual, I’ve attached charts from one of my recent projects, illustrating how the top three personality trait predictors, as measured by the HPI, relate to employee performance across two competencies, as modeled by XGBoost and visualized using Partial Dependence Plots - a global ML interpretation tool. Notice how these relationships aren’t simply positive or negative but show clear non-linearities.

With interpretable ML, exploring these nuances becomes pretty straightforward. If you haven’t dived into these waters yet, give it a try - you might be surprised (or not) by what you find 😉

P.S. Below is a snippet of R code if you'd like to start experimenting with your own data.
