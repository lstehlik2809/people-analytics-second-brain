I just finished watching Netflix's excellent sport documentary [Sprint](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28669701/), which shows the ups and downs of several top male and female sprinters during their 2023 season.

In the final episode, while discussing [Sha'Carri Richardson’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha%27Carri_Richardson) victory in the women's 100m race at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest 2023, the reporter highlighted how surprising and exceptional her win was, especially considering she did not qualify directly for the final (i.e., by being among the top two in one of the semifinals).

The data enthusiast in me felt compelled to investigate just how surprising this achievement truly was. So, I examined the [data from the women's 100m finals and semifinals at all World Athletics Championships from 2001 to 2023](https://worldathletics.org/competition/calendar-results?hideCompetitionsWithNoResults=true&competitionGroupId=6), and used a slopegraph and a multilevel Spearman's rank correlation to analyze the consistency of finalists’ rankings across the finals and semis.

As the plot below illustrates, the consistency is relatively high (*r* = 0.8), but it's not absolute, which leaves room for some surprising wins, which are rare but not impossible. However, in Sha'Carri's case, imho, her victory doesn’t seem particularly surprising in light of the available data, as she moved “only” from third place in the semis to first in the final (which, of course, doesn’t make her victory any less remarkable).

We could also ask how those who improved their rankings achieved this. Was it because they ran faster, or was it that their competitors ran slower in the final compared to the semis? A comparison of time differences between the finals and semis for those who improved, worsened, or maintained their ranking suggests that it's a combination of both. Those who improved or maintained their rankings tended to improve their times in the final, though the former group did so more significantly. Conversely, those who dropped in ranking generally ran slower in the final in comparison with the semi.

Not sure if there are any deeper lessons to be drawn from these results, perhaps just that while patterns and predictability exist, there is always room for surprises, the awareness of which can help nurture resilience and flexibility, key qualities for navigating uncertain environments. But maybe I just have a limited imagination, so feel free to share any suggestions for a better lesson 🙂

What I am 100% sure of, though, is that I enjoyed playing with the data a lot. If you'd like to play with them yourself, you can download them for both women and men from the two tables below.
