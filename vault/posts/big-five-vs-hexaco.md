One of my old work friends asked me recently whether I’d recommend a [Big Five–](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) or [HEXACO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure)-based psychometric tool for employee selection, with predictive validity as the main criterion. Not being a super-expert on this topic, I told her that AFAIK they’re more or less equivalent, with HEXACO having that extra Honesty–Humility dimension, so if counterproductive work behavior (CWB) is a big deal for them, HEXACO might have a slight edge over the Big Five.

To double-check my reasoning and advice, I dug into the available evidence and luckily came across a solid meta-analytic review by [Pletzer & Abrahams (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X25000673) that compares the predictive validity of these two models for task performance and CWB, among other things.

Interestingly, when you look at the overlapping dimensions one by one, the Big Five seems to have a slight edge in predicting both task performance and CWB—see the charts based on the paper’s data below.

*Note: The charts aren’t from the paper itself—I made them using the paper’s data, so any discrepancies are on me.*

But when you combine inter-correlations from the sample-size–weighted meta-analytic correlation matrix below and estimate overall explained variance, the conclusion flips: HEXACO outperforms the Big Five in predicting both CWB (20.1%* vs. 14.9%) and task performance (6.7% vs. 4.3%).

\* *When estimating the overall explained variance of outcome variables by individual personality models, using the formula $R^2 = R_{xy}^T R_{xx}^{-1} R_{xy}$, where $R_{xx}$ is the correlation matrix of the predictor traits (e.g., the 5x5 matrix for the Big Five) and $R_{xy}$ is the vector of correlations between each trait and the outcome (CWB or task performance), I obtained a slightly higher estimate of 20.3%. This could be due to a small bug in the code (see the snippet below), but since the other three estimates are identical, it may instead result from a minor typo in the authors’ paper.* 🤔

The reason seems to be that HEXACO includes the extra Honesty–Humility trait (which captures ethical variance and is a decent predictor of negative workplace behaviors), shows higher predictive validity for the generally most predictive trait (Conscientiousness), and has less inter-correlation between traits (so their predictive power overlaps less).

Curious about others’ experiences with switching from the Big Five to HEXACO. What motivated the change for you, and was it worth it? Asking for a friend (and myself) 🙏🙂
