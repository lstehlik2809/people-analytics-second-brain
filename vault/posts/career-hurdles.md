I came across an interesting meta-analytic review by [Ng & Feldman (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879114000761) that might be useful for setting priors about the hurdles people face when it comes to their perception of subjective career success (SCS). The authors estimated the impact of 54 specific hurdles, grouped into six categories that can potentially lower people's SCS: 

1. Trait-related
2. Social-network-related
3. Skill-related
4. Organizational and job-related
5. Motivational
6. Background-related hurdles

On average, the strongest negative effects were found in the social and organizational hurdle groups, followed by trait-related and motivational hurdles. Interestingly, background-related and skill-related hurdles weren’t strongly associated with SCS. I’d say that’s good news, considering how non/malleable some of these types of hurdles can be 🤔

P.S. As is evident from the code snippet above, the attached chart isn't straight from the paper. I made it based on the results presented there, so any mistakes in the chart are on me!
