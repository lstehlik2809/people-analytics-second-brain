title: How do we perceive probability words?
description: Have you ever wondered exactly how much chance of success people give a project when they say they believe in it? If so, then you may find this post useful, as it attempts to answer that question at least in part with data.

Nowadays - probably also due to the Covid pandemic and the associated predictions - we are more and more frequently encountering various probabilistic statements, but these are often expressed not in terms of precise numerical probabilities, but in terms of relatively vague probability words such as "probably", "maybe", "unlikely", etc.

Since people may imagine different probabilities under these words, it would be useful to have something like a glossary to help us decipher these words and indicate what people usually mean when they use them. 

Fortunately, there are some studies that examine what numerical probabilities people typically associate with probability words.

For this purpose, I used a collection of 123 responses to the [Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider's internet survey](https://github.com/wadefagen/datasets/tree/master/Perception-of-Probability-Words) and created two similar graphs based on them. The first shows the distribution of the numerical probabilities that people associate with each word, and these are sorted in the graph by the median value of the corresponding probability in descending order. The second graph then differs only in that the words are sorted by the size of the interquartile range in descending order.

The first graph can thus help us to use the right word, which in the mind of the other person is most likely to evoke the same probability we want to express. The second graph can then help us to identify the most noisy probability words, for which we will know to ask for a more precise definition because we will be aware that people may imagine very different probabilities under these words.

How about your perception of probability words? Is there anything in the graphs that surprised you? Would you expect differences between cultures? And what about other demographics? Btw, the original dataset also includes some demographic variables such as age, gender, and education level, so I'll probably come back to this question in a future post.
